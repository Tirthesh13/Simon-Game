# Simon-Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The game tests the player's memory by requiring them to repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors.

**Overview**
The Simon Game is a simple memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. With each level, the sequence gets longer, and the game becomes more challenging. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, particularly in handling user interactions, animations, and game logic using JavaScript and jQuery.

**How to Play**
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors displayed on the buttons.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. The game will continue adding one more color to the sequence with each level.
5. If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and you can start over by pressing any key.

**Features**
1. Responsive Design: The game is designed to work on different screen sizes.
2. Interactive Buttons: The buttons light up and play sounds when clicked.
3. Dynamic Sequence Generation: Each level generates a new sequence that the player must remember and repeat.
4. Game Over Handling: The game provides feedback when the player makes a mistake and allows for restarting the game.

**Technologies Used**
1. HTML5: Structure of the web page.
2. CSS3: Styling and layout of the game interface.
4. JavaScript (with jQuery): Game logic, handling user input, animations, and sound effects.
